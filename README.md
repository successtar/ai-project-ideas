# AI Project Ideas
This repository contains examples of projects leveraging AI integration for real-world solutions.

1.	Language Detector - A tool where content can be entered in any language, and the AI automatically detects the language.
2.	Content Summarizer - A feature that condenses lengthy content into concise summaries.
3.	AI Chatbox with Memory - An interactive chatbox that maintains conversational context, remembering what was discussed in previous prompts.

The samples implementation are written to make api call to Ollama.
